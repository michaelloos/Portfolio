Project using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis on IDMb data to determine key characterisitcs of a highly rated movie. 

## Libraries
* pandas
* numpy 
* matplotlib
* __future__
* statsmodels
* random
* normal
* thinkstats2
* thinkplot


## Data
[IDMb Data](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset)

## Methods
EDA performed on variables such Year, Duration, Average Vote, Budget, and Metascore. Analysis includes scatter plots, histograms, PMF, CDF, hypothesis test, and linear regression. 

## Results
* We can measure the success of a movie in several ways based on US Gross Income, Average Rating, and Metascore
* While there is a high correlation between average rating and metascore, there is little correlation between Income and Rating
* We can predict the average vote by income, votes, and duration
* We can predict the Gross Income by average rating, votes, and duration
* Average rating, income, votes, and durations are significant contributors
