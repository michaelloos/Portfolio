# Image Classification-Big Ten Teams

Project using Python to scrape images and create a neural network to predict which Big Ten team an image contains. 

## Libraries
* selenium
* hashlib 
* PIL
* io
* os
* requests
* time

## Programs
* Image Scraper.py: Uses selenium web driver to save images of each team to their own folder
* MLoos_Project 1.ipynb: Creates multiple neural networks to predict team with an image and analyzes results

## Data
Images of Big Ten teams from Google Images

## Methods
Convolutional Neural Networks were created with different parameters to predict team within each image

## Results
63% overall accuracy. The model did well for teams that did not have red as a primary color but struggled with the teams whose main color is red.
