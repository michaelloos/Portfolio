# CFB Betting Model

Project using Python to wrangle data and R to create and assess different models for predicting the outcomes of college football games against the spread.

## Libraries
* Python
  * Pandas
  * Numpy 
* R
  * dplyr
  * tidyverse 
  * ggplot2
  * car
  * readr
  * corrplot
  * Hmisc
  * QuantPsyc
  * PerformanceAnalytics

## Data
* [Data Sets](https://github.com/michaelloos/Portfolio/tree/main/CFB%20Betting%20Model/Data)

## Methods
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks were created to predict winners of each game and winners against the spread.

## Results
* Logistic Regression: 64.8% accuracy of game winner.
* Linear Regression: 48.29% accuracy against the spread.
* Sklearn Neural Network: 52.1% against the spread. 54.0% against the point total (over/under). 
* Keras Neural Network: 52.1% against the spread. 54.6% against the point total (over/under).
