# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project using Python to create and assess different machine learning models for predicting whether credit card transactions are fraudulent or not using variables such as transaction amount, location, merchant type, and cardholder characteristics. Modeling methods include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

## Libraries
* pandas
* numpy 
* matplotlib
* datetime
* geopy
* sklearn
* yellowbrick
* statsmodels
* pydotplus
* IPython

## Data
Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection

## Methods
Logistic Regression, Descision Tree, and Random Forest models were created and compared to determine best result in predicting credit card fraud. 

## Results
Random Forest model had the highest accuracy but produced a high number of false postives. 14% of predicted fraud transactions were false positives. Only 64.5% of fraud transactions were correctly identified as fraud.
